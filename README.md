# General Pervasive

We aim to focus on a potential scam based on a fake interaction between a parent and their doctor/GP.

In the UK, the NHS has a publicly available database of all GPs (https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-gp) with all the GPs’ data potentially available for web scraping

This demo simulates fake messages sent to those residents living close to each GP with a seemingly urgent message that requests for some private/sensitive data. By continuing the interaction, the message could eventually ask to ‘verify’ payment details to then capture this data

Given that parents are 1) busy, and 2) care about their child, they would more likely review and respond to messages from a trusted source like a GP
